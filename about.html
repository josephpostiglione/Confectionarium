        <h2>Our Founder</h2>

        <h3>Hank Fredlington</h3>

        <p>Hank always loved baking, but he didn’t know the best tools or techniques, so he created his own recipe: A cup of creativity, a dash of community spirit, and a liberal glaze of can-do attitude, and Confectionarium was born.</p>
